        <h3>What Do You Need?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Fishing rod and reel</strong> â€“ This is what you use to cast and reel in fish.</li>
          <li><strong>Fishing line</strong> â€“ The strong string that holds your hook and bait.</li>
          <li><strong>Hooks</strong> â€“ Little metal hooks to catch the fish.</li>
          <li><strong>Bait or lures</strong> â€“ Worms, bugs, or pretend fish that attract real fish.</li>
          <li><strong>Bobber (optional)</strong> â€“ A float that helps you see when a fish bites!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to Fish</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Put bait or a lure on your hook (ask an adult for help with hooks).</li>
          <li>Hold your rod, press the button or open the bail, and cast your line into the water.</li>
          <li>Wait and watch your line or bobber. Be patient!</li>
          <li>When you feel a tug or see the bobber go under, gently lift your rod to set the hook.</li>
          <li>Reel in your fish slowly and carefully. Congratulations!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fishing is Fun!</h3>
        <p>
          Remember, fishing is about having fun and enjoying the outdoors. Sometimes you catch a fish, and sometimes you just enjoy the sunshine and fresh air. Every trip is an adventure!
